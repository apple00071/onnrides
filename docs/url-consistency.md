# URL Consistency in OnnRides

This document explains the URL consistency implementation in the OnnRides application, specifically regarding the home page URLs.

## Overview

The OnnRides application previously had two different URLs that served as home pages:

1. Root URL: `http://localhost:3000/` or `https://onnrides.com/`
2. Home path: `http://localhost:3000/home` or `https://onnrides.com/home`

Having two different URLs for the same content can lead to:

- Confusion for users
- SEO issues with duplicate content
- Inconsistent behavior with maintenance mode
- Difficulty in tracking analytics

## Implementation

To ensure URL consistency, we've implemented the following solution:

### 1. Server-Side Redirect

The `/home` path now redirects to the root URL (`/`). This is implemented as a server-side redirect in `app/(main)/home/page.tsx`:

```typescript
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation';

// Server component that immediately redirects to the root page
export default function HomePage() {
  // Server-side redirect
  redirect('/');
  
  // This part won't execute due to the redirect, but is included as a fallback
  return null;
}
```

### 2. Middleware Debug Headers

The middleware has been updated to include debug headers showing which path is being processed:

```typescript
// Add debug headers
redirectResponse.headers.set('X-Maintenance-Redirect', 'true');
redirectResponse.headers.set('X-Debug-Path', pathname);
```

### 3. Updated Documentation

The maintenance mode documentation has been updated to mention the URL consistency implementation and its importance for maintenance mode functionality.

## Testing

You can test the URL consistency implementation with the following npm script:

```bash
npm run test:redirect
```

This script checks that:
- `/home` redirects to the root URL (`/`)
- The root URL serves content properly

## Benefits

This implementation ensures:

1. **Consistent User Experience**: Users always land on the same home page regardless of which URL they use.

2. **SEO Optimization**: Avoids duplicate content issues for search engines.

3. **Reliable Maintenance Mode**: Ensures maintenance mode applies uniformly across all URLs.

4. **Accurate Analytics**: All home page visits are tracked under a single URL.

## Handling Legacy Links

Any existing links to `/home` will continue to work, but users will be redirected to the root URL. This provides backward compatibility while ensuring a consistent experience going forward.
